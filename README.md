# API Examples

This project demonstrates various methods of serving data using REST, GraphQL, and gRPC. It uses a DuckDB database containing U.S. housing data as the primary data source.

## Features

- **REST Server**: A simple RESTful API using FastAPI (or Flask, etc.) to expose the data.
- **GraphQL Server**: An example GraphQL server implementation to query the same dataset.
- **gRPC Server**: A gRPC-based service providing structured data responses.
- **DuckDB**: Data is stored locally in a DuckDB file (usa_housing.duckdb).

## TODO:

- Add frontend to demonstrate interactions with each API
